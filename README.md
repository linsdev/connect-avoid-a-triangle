# Connect: Avoid a triangle

There are several points on the circle. The player draws a line connecting any two points avoiding the formation of a triangle from one-color lines. If nothing remains as to construct a triangle, the player is losing.

By the way, the game has an Easter egg. Can you find it?

## How It's Made

It was developed on the Java using framework libGDX.
The game uses shaders for drawing a circle and text.
I'm using some tricks for optimizing rendering, e.g. render to texture.

## Release
